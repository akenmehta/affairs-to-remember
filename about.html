		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Unde magnam minima nesciunt, incidunt voluptatem consectetur, soluta nihil reiciendis, impedit adipisci officiis esse accusantium. Saepe totam, maiores? Commodi quae saepe quam.</p>

		<h3>Q&A's</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p class="question">1. Why do I need a Power of Attorney?</p>
				<p>If you were in an accident and you were no longer able to make decisions for yourself, who would do this on your behalf? A Power of Attorney is a legal document that appoints a person (or persons) that you have selected, to make those decisions on your behalf.  Those decisions could be financial decisions like paying your bills (Power of Attorney for Property). Those decisions could be personal care and health decisions like where you would live or the medical care you would receive (Power of Attorney for Personal Care).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="question">2. What if I don’t have a Power of Attorney?</p>
				<p>If you don’t want to have a Power of Attorney, no one can make you appoint one.  If you don’t have a Power of Attorney and something happens to you, your family members can make health care decisions or they can apply to become a “guardian” of property. Alternatively a close friend could apply to act on your behalf in these matters.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="question">3. Who should I choose for a Power of Attorney?</p>
				<p>Whether it is Power of Attorney for Property or Power of Attorney for Personal Care, you should choose someone that you trust and who knows your wishes. You might consider naming an alternate in case the person you name is unable to fulfill the duties.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="question">4. Is a Power of Attorney for Personal Care the same as a living will?</p>
				<p>No. Some people refer to a ‘living will’ as a document that outlines the treatment decisions they would want made if they were not able to communicate. An example would be if there was no hope for recovery, having a do not resuscitate instruction or other medical treatment wishes that you express. This information could be included in the Power of Attorney for Personal Care. Other decisions related to personal care could be shelter, clothing, nutrition and safety.  The scope of these decisions is defined in the Power of Attorney document.</p>
				<p>A Power of Attorney is a legal document in which you name a specific person to act on your behalf.</p>
				<p>A companion document to the Power of Attorney for Personal Care is the Health Care Directive, also known as a “Living Will”. The Health Care Directive is the means by which an individual gives directions about medical treatment to health care providers. A copy of the Directive should be provided to the Attorney for Personal Care so he/she is clear about the individual’s treatment preferences.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="question">5. What is the difference between a Will and Power of Attorney?</p>
				<p>They are different legal documents. Simply put, Power of Attorney applies only when you are alive and ceases to be effective when you die. A Last Will for Property and Estate takes effect upon your death and covers the distribution of your property after you die. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="question">6. Some considerations when choosing a Guardian for your children.</p>
				<p>When choosing a guardian for your minor children some factors to consider are:
					<ul>
						<li>
							  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></span>
							do they share the same basic values?</li>
						<li>
							<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></span>
							location (proximity helps to minimize the disruption  to the children)</li>
						<li>
							<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></span>
							age of the potential Guardians</li>
						<li>
							<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></span>
							do they share a similar lifestyle?</li>
						<li>
							<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></span>
							what happens if the Guardians split up or divorce?</li>
						<li>
							<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></span>
							will they require a larger home or vehicle?</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="question">7. What information should I include when I meet with a Will and Estate Lawyer to finalize my Will?</p>
			</li>
			<p>When you meet with a Will and Estate Lawyer or tax expert, you will want to have:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></span>
					a list of your assets including ownership or interest in assets outside of Ontario and Canada
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></span>
					an understanding of your common liabilities such as mortgages, loans or other debts</li>
			</ul>
